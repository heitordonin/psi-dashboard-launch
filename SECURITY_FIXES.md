# Security Fixes Implementation

This document outlines the comprehensive security fixes implemented in the Psiclo application.

## Critical Fixes Applied

### 1. Database Function Security (CRITICAL - FIXED âœ…)
- **Issue**: Functions lacked `SET search_path TO ''` protection against SQL injection
- **Fix**: Added search path protection to ALL database functions:
  - `get_user_plan_features` - User subscription feature access
  - `is_admin` - Admin privilege verification
  - `validate_whatsapp_log_owner` - WhatsApp log ownership validation
  - `hash_value` - Secure value hashing
  - `encrypt_value` - Data encryption function
  - `decrypt_value` - Data decryption function
  - `get_decrypted_profile` - Secure profile data access
  - `get_encryption_key` - Encryption key retrieval
  - `get_user_patient_limit` - Patient limit calculation
  - `log_security_event` - Security audit logging
- **Impact**: Prevents SQL injection through search path manipulation attacks

### 2. Business Data Protection (MEDIUM - FIXED âœ…)
- **Issue**: Public readability of `subscription_plans` and `banks` tables
- **Fix**: Restricted access to authenticated users only:
  - Removed public SELECT policies from sensitive business data
  - Added authentication requirement for subscription plans access
  - Maintained secure bank data access for active banks only
- **Impact**: Prevents unauthorized access to business-sensitive information

### 3. Enhanced Security Monitoring (NEW - ADDED âœ…)
- **Addition**: Comprehensive security event logging system
- **Features**:
  - `log_security_event()` function for audit trail
  - Enhanced admin escalation prevention with logging
  - Secure audit log deletion policies (admin-only)
  - Performance indexes for security queries
- **Impact**: Enables real-time security monitoring and incident response

### 3. Authentication Security Enhancement
- **Issue**: OTP expiry too long (5 minutes), weak admin verification
- **Fixes**:
  - Reduced OTP expiry to 2 minutes
  - Enhanced admin verification with dual checks
  - Added secure admin guard hook
  - Implemented proper session validation
- **Impact**: Reduces attack window and strengthens privilege verification

### 4. Row-Level Security Hardening
- **Issue**: Users could potentially modify their admin status
- **Fix**: Added secure RLS policy preventing admin status modification
- **Impact**: Prevents privilege escalation attacks

### 5. Stripe Integration Security
- **Fixes**:
  - Added comprehensive input validation
  - Implemented rate limiting (5 checkout attempts per hour per user)
  - Enhanced error handling to prevent information disclosure
  - Moved Price IDs to environment variables
- **Impact**: Prevents abuse and secures payment processing

### 6. Enhanced Input Validation
- **Fixes**:
  - Strengthened CPF validation with additional security checks
  - Added sequential number detection
  - Enhanced range validation
- **Impact**: Prevents malicious input injection

### 7. Rate Limiting Implementation
- **Additions**:
  - Stripe operations: 10/minute per user
  - Authentication: 5/minute per IP
  - Admin operations: 20/minute per user
  - Checkout: 5/hour per user
- **Impact**: Prevents brute force and DoS attacks

### 8. Security Headers Configuration
- **Additions**:
  - Content Security Policy (CSP)
  - XSS Protection headers
  - CORS security hardening
  - Frame options protection
- **Impact**: Prevents various web-based attacks

### 9. Audit Logging
- **Addition**: Created admin_audit_log table for tracking admin actions
- **Impact**: Enables security monitoring and compliance

## Additional Security Files Created

1. `src/hooks/useSecureAdminGuard.ts` - Secure admin access control
2. `src/utils/rateLimiter.ts` - Rate limiting utilities
3. `src/utils/securityHeaders.ts` - Security headers configuration
4. `SECURITY_FIXES.md` - This documentation

## Environment Variables Required

Add these to your Supabase Edge Function secrets:

```
STRIPE_PRICE_GESTAO=your_gestao_price_id
STRIPE_PRICE_PSI_REGULAR=your_psi_regular_price_id
```

## Next Steps for Complete Security

1. **Configure Stripe Price IDs**: Replace placeholder price IDs with actual Stripe Price IDs
2. **Enable Leaked Password Protection**: Configure in Supabase Auth settings
3. **Monitor Logs**: Regularly check admin audit logs for suspicious activity
4. **Test Rate Limits**: Verify rate limiting works correctly
5. **Security Headers**: Ensure all security headers are properly configured in production
